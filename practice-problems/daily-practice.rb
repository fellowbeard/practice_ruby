#  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number times 3.
#     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [3, 6, 9].

# def mult(array)
#   new_num = []
#   array.each do |number|
#     new_num << number * 3
#   end
#   return array
# end

# word = "bookkeeper"
# letter_frequencies = {}
# index = 0
# while index < word.length
#   letter = word[index]
#   if letter_frequencies[letter] == nil

#   end
#   letter_frequencies[letter] += 1
#   index += 1
# end
# p letter_frequencies

#  4. Convert a hash into an array of arrays.

# pairs = []
# items.each do |name, price|
#   pairs << [name, price]
# end
# p pairs

#  5. Convert a hash into an array of hashes using the keys from each hash as the :id key in each of the array's hashes.
#     For example, {321 => {name: "Alice", age: 31}, 322 => {name: "Maria", age: 27}} becomes [{id: 321, name: "Alice", age: 31}, {id: 322, name: "Maria", age: 27}].

# people = {321 => {name: "Alice", age: 31}, 322 => {name: "Maria", age: 27}}

# people.each do |id, person|
#   person[:id] = id
#   people_array << person
# end
# p people_array

#  6. Convert an array of strings into a hash with keys for each string in the array and values for the number of times the string appears in the array.
#     For example, ["do", "or", "do", "not"] becomes {"do" => 2, "or" => 1, "not" => 1}.

# strings = ["do", "or", "do", "not"]
# strings_hash = {}
# index = 0
# while index < strings.length
#   string = strings[index]
#   if strings_hash[string] == nil
#     strings_hash[string] = 0
#   end
#   strings_hash[string] += 1
#   index += 1
# end
# p strings_hash

#  7. Convert a hash into a flat array containing all the hashâ€™s keys and values.
#     For example, {"a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3, "d" => 4} becomes ["a", 1, "b", 2, "c", 3, "d", 4].

# hash = {"a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3, "d" => 4}
# array = []
# hash.each do |key, value|
#   array << key
#   array << value
# end
# p array


#  8. Combine data from a hash with names and prices and an array of hashes with names, colors, and weights to make a new hash.
#     For example, {"chair" => 75, "book" => 15} and [{name: "chair", color: "red", weight: 10}, {name: "book", color: "black", weight: 1}] becomes {"chair" => {price: 75, color: "red", weight: 10}, "book" => {price: 15, color: "black", weight: 1}}.



#  9. Convert an array of hashes into a hash of arrays, using the author as keys and the titles as values.
#     For example, [{author: "Jeff Smith", title: "Bone"}, {author: "George Orwell", title: "1984"}, {author: "Jeff Smith", title: "RASL"}] becomes {"Jeff Smith" => ["Bone", "RASL"], "George Orwell" => ["1984"]}.

# 10. Given a hash, create a new hash that has the keys and values switched.
#     For example, {"a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3} becomes {1 => "a", 2 => "b", 3 => "c"}.
