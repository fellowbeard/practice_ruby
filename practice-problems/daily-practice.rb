# 1. Write a function that takes in a number and returns the number times two. Then run the function and print the result.

# def double(number)
#   return number * 2
# end

# p double(6)


# 2. Write a function that takes in a string and returns the string with all capital letters. Then run the function and print the result.

# def capitalize(word)
#   return word.upcase
# end

# p capitalize("poop")

# 3. Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns the first number subtracted by the second. Then run the function and print the result.

# def add_num(num1, num2)
#   return num1 - num2
# end

# p add_num(3, 6)

# 4. Write a function that takes in a number and returns the number times itself. Then run the function and print the result.

# def double(num)
#   num * num
# end

# p double(6)

# 5. Write a function that takes in a string and returns the first letter of the string. Then run the function and print the result.

# def first_letter(word)
#   word[0]
# end

# p first_letter("shit")

# 6. Write a function that takes in three strings and returns a string that combines all three strings with spaces in between. Then run the function and print the result.

# def split(word1, word2, word3)
#   "#{word1}, #{word2}, #{word3}"
# end

# p split("poop", "pee", "diarrhea")

# 7. Write a function that takes in a number and returns the number as a string. Then run the function and print the result.

# def string(number)
#   number.to_s
# end

# p string(8)

# 8. Write a function that takes in a string and returns the string repeated 5 times. Then run the function and print the result.

# def repeat(word)
#   word * 5
# end

# p repeat("poop")

# 9. Write a function that takes in 3 numbers and returns the average (the sum divided by 3.0). Then run the function and print the result.

# def average(num1, num2, num3)
#   (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3
# end

# p average(3, 6, 9)

# 10. Write a function that takes in a number and returns the number times 10 plus 30. Then run the function and print the result.

# def increase(number)
#   (number * 10) + 30
# end

# p increase(25)
